          Every time talking over iPhone with the woman I was dating at the time, I tried to listen as attentive as possible. She indeed has expressed sincere gratitude multiple times, but the behavior does not come from my nature but an effort to be popular with her. I followed the advice written in a love book such as "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus." However, maybe because I naturally enjoy learning new things, I could enjoy attentive listening, so I often put it into practice because she and I both genuinely liked it.

          Though I don't have a strong desire for others to listen to me, when I chat with friends I sometimes feel that the jumbled thoughts in my head get organized. Unexpected words from my friends can give birth to ideas, and the support or opposition from my companions can give me confidence in my own thoughts or prompt me to reconsider whether it's really a good idea. That's why coffee breaks are something I love so much and cherish. Additionally as someone who cannot help taking lots of notes, once I part ways with my friends, I always immediately jot down the things that resonated with me before I forget.

          I deeply understand the desire of categorizing notes. I also had ended with tons of folders, every single time.
