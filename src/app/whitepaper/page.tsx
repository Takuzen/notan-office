          Introduction<br/>
          notan is a tool that helps organize your thoughts by toggling between writing and conversation. Its main building blocks are minimalist note-taking functionality, removing traditional folders, and conversational walls that listen to your words and provide support through attentive questioning when you get stuck.
          Another feature of notan is its focus on Natural Language User Interface (NLUI). We firmly believe that natural language interaction is the next evolution of user interfaces, transitioning from CLI to GUI.

          The Problem<br/>
          Through exchanging words with others, we often find that our thoughts become clearer and new ideas emerge. However, in the transactional and busy world of capitalism, people who genuinely listen to your words are precious. If you can think of someone like that in your life, remember that you are fortunate, and cherish them. Even for those who are loved and listened to, it can be difficult to hesitate to talk about themselves when considering the convenience of others. The existence of therapists and the fact that many people pay for their services to be heard and listened to demonstrate the challenging nature of sincerely listening and making someone feel heard by considering their needs.

          The Solution<br/>
          notan does not aim to replace the presence of friends, family, or partners. It is designed to be a companion-like presence that allows you to express what is inside you without worrying, especially during times of loneliness and distress, and gently pushes you forward. We are developing notan with the goal of maximizing serendipity. By intentionally not implementing folder functionality, we understand the allure of categorization and aim to prevent wasting time being immersed in organizing pages neatly into folders. If you want to see pages related to a specific topic, you can achieve similar functionality by entering &bdquo;Show me pages about [topic].&bdquo; We hope you understand that our focus is on connecting scattered thoughts together.
          <br/><br/>
          Serendipity<br/>
          This word derives from the Persian fairy tale &bdquo;The Three Princes of Serendip,&bdquo; which means accidental discovery. In the story, three princes set out on a journey by order of the king, and along the way, they solve a series of challenging problems and ultimately obtain unexpected good fortune. Through this tool, we aim to maximize serendipity. By not deliberately implementing folder functionality, we understand the appeal of categorization and prevent wasting time by getting absorbed in organizing pages. Instead, we prioritize the connection of thoughts. We hope you understand this aspect.

          About Paper<br/>
          While we deeply love cutting-edge technology, we also believe that writing on paper is important and will become increasingly valuable. Writing on paper is optimal as an aid to enter a state of Zen-like concentration. The act of creating, deeply contemplating, and making sound judgments will be increasingly valued by humanity. As a first step, notan provides a machine learning scanning service. It seamlessly consolidates analog and digital notes, allowing you to access them immediately, just like digital documents. It also serves as a backup to give you peace of mind in case your precious notes are lost.
          <br/><br/>
          In Conclusion<br/>
          notan is still in its infancy. If you are passionate about shaping notan into an innovative tool and want to join us in the journey to make people&lsquo;s lives around the world flow more comfortably and smoothly, please get in touch.
